		<p>We caught eye of the data set given to us by CoStar and thought to analyze it for useful insights on past news stories. </p>
		<p>Since Margaret and Yi had experience with R, it was only natural for us to utilize R in order to analyze the data, and to utilize the shiny package in order to create a website.</p> 
		<p>We created a basic visualization that allows you to analyze the given data (words from the title and summaries of articles, dates) and sort the data by tags and country. </p>
		<p>The about us page and analysis page were created separately using basic HTML and CSS. All content on these pages were handwritten to showcase our results aside from the main app.</p>
