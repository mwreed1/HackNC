	 <h1>The R Ladies</h1>
		<p>We caught eye of the data set given to us by CoStar and thought to analyze it for useful insights on past news stories. </p>
		<p>Since Margaret and Yi had experience with R, it was only natural for us to utilize R in order to analyze the data, and to utilize the shiny package in order to create a website. Mainly, we created a basic visualization that allows you to analyze the given data (words from the title and summaries of articles, dates) and sort the data by tags and country. </p>
		<p>In particular, we utilized RMarkdown to create the analysis page, HTML, CSS, and Shiny to format these three webpages, and flexdashboard to create the visualization. Primarily utilized RStudio and GitHub during development.</p>
		<p>The about us page and analysis page were created separately using basic HTML and CSS. All content on these pages were handwritten to showcase our results aside from the main app. Thanks to Tom Weishaar for making <a href = "https://github.com/open-meta/uiStub/">this lovely template</a> that was instrumental to this website's design. </p>
